# JavaScript

a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying
timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript 
is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard 
web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

# HTML

the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining 
paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.


# CSS

A language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example 
setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
